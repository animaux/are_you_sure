# Are you sure?

Add a warning message to the backend if you try to leave the page with unsaved changes.

## Usage

Install and activate. Options are currently only configurable in `assets/are-you-sure.publish.js`. 

## Bugs and limitations

+ currently not detecting changes in [Editor for Symphony](https://github.com/symphonists/editor_for_symphony) fields, any hints?

## Acknowledgement

This extension simply implements the jQuery Plugin: [Are-You-Sure (Dirty Form Detection)](https://github.com/codedance/jquery.AreYouSure/).

This extension is based on Nils Hörrmann’s [Backend Assets](https://github.com/symphonists/backend_assets) which is based on Michael Eichelsdörfer’s [Admin CSS Override](https://github.com/michael-e/admin_css_override).
